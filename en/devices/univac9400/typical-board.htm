       <p>This is a typical modul from the system. The DTL-IC's are clearly visible.
       Around every IC diodes are arranged which were usually executed as logical AND gate.
       Along this way a lot of different "logical chips" could be constructed. Actually some
       transistors were integrated in the IC, so the difference to the second-generation
       calculators is very low. Many modules from the system were still built with discrete
       transistor technology. The complete tape devices are from the mid 60s, so they are
       built without integrated circuits.</p>
