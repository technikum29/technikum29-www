	<p>Broadcasting was launched in Germany in 1923, being the third country in
	   the world (right after the USA (1921) and Great Britain (1922)). From the
	   technical point, it even would have been possible to launch large-scale
	   broadcasting in 1920.</p>

	<p>Detectors are passive tuners which are powered straight from the electromagnetic
	   wave which is recieved via a very big antenna. Therefore there was only a
	   headphones plug and no loudspeakers at all. To adjust the device, the user had
	   to poke with a small needle on a crystal, having only a small chance to recieve
	   a powerful broadcast station. The crystal was a small 5&nbsp;mm galena or pyrite
	   unit with physical characteristics of a diode at some special configurations.
	   If the user found such a configuration, the crystal served as rectifier.
	   In the early 1920s, this setup was a cheap alternative to the expansive radio sets.
	   At the right hand in the picture you can see a typical manual to instruct
	   the user into early radio technology.</p>
	   
	<p>It is astonishing to see the incredible speed of the development of broadcasting
	   systems. Beginning with very simple devices like the one above, using crystals
	   for demulation, the technology became mature very quickly. This process took
	   no more than 15 years from the first steps to near perfection.
	   This development is reflected in the apperance of the devices as well. While
	   the first recievers were of a very technical design, later devices turned into
	   wonderful pieces of furniture, fitting neatly into the average upper class
	   household. We have illustrated this page with examples from both types of
	   devices.</p>

    <p>It is astonishing to see the incredible pace at which the development of
       broadcasting systems took place. Beginning with very simple devices using
       crystals for demodulation the technology matured very fast and resulted
       in the design and development of high performance transmitters and receivers
       employing super heterodyning and the like.
       This paved the way from simple crystal receivers which required special
       skills to operate to everyday radios which were easy to operate and soon
       could be found in nearly every household. A process which took a mere 15
       years from its first steps to near perfection.
       This development is reflected in the appearance of the devices as well. While
       the first receivers were of a very technical design, later devices turned into
       wonderful pieces of furniture, fitting neatly into the average household and
       denying the fact that the receiver itself was a rather complicated piece of
       equipment. This page shows some selected examples from the collection of the
       museum which contains about 150 different receivers.

      <p>The short time between the moderate launch of broadcasting in the early 1920s
	  and its perfection is amazing. The era of broadcasting began in Germany in 1923,
	  at first with very limited reception quality. 15 years later the quality of
	  reception was almost perfect. At the beginning the apparatures had a very
	  technical design (exactly like today), but since the 30s the radio apparatures
	  changed to partially attractive pieces of furniture. Chosen examples from the
	  museum-holding (150 pieces) for both kinds are shown on this page.</p>

		    This is a reciever made by <b>SABA</b> (year of manufacture 1927) with
			open cover. You can see three inductors and rotary capacitors. Therefore

			decorated with marquetries (not visible in the picture detail) and even

	<p>In the 1920s, the electric power supply has not been installed all over the
	   country yet, therefore the first broadcasting recievers were made for
	   battery operation. Therefore listening loudly and frequently to the radio
	   was an expensive buiseness, since batteries discharged quickly.
	   <br/>The following devices were ready for the mains supply.</p>

	<p>There have always been companies which built very stylish devices. You could

	   motor-channel search and cable-remote control: SABA Freiburg 3D
	   (1954). This milestone features five built-in speakers, having
	   such an impressing sound that even today's people with all their

    <p>The following pictures show some receivers of outstanding design
       and outstanding technical properties. Apart from these the
       museum's collection contains a lot of different receivers
       covering all stages of the development of public radio
       broadcasting.
       These receivers include crystal radios, battery powered receivers
       from the 1920s, a 'Luxus Super' (1930s) as well as the first postwar
       receiver equipped with motorized search functionality and remote
       control by cable, the SABA Freiburg 3D. The sound of this receiver
       is so rich and impressive that even young people are faszinated and
       admire this 50 year old technical miracle.</p>

	<p>Loudspeakers were integrated into broadcasting devices since about 1932.
	   Furthermore the devices were (of course) still adapted to contemporary
	   style. These Telefunken export devices (T650 and T500) especially stick
	   out. Being built as "super" models (improving recieve quality by generating
	   an intermediate frequency) the technical working was very good.

        <p class="bildtext">
            Having intelligent all-in-one furniture suitable for all kinds of music is an old dream
            which appeared some years after the introducion of mass broadcasting. The radiogramophone
            on the left is the <b>Telefunken 650 GK</b> from 1931/32. The record player was quite
            modern, featuring a magnetic system and electric motor. On the other hand it still used
            gramophone needles and the needlessly weighty pick-up stressed the records.
            Nevertheless the sound quality of the radiogramophone was much better, compared to an
            ordinary gramophone player. The chassis is made out of noble walnut trees, therefore
            this piece of furniture was very expensive.

            1956 and shown on the left, is another outstanding piece of equipment.
            It is a so called "Kofferradio" (<i>suitcase radio</i>) since it is portable

			carry-on-baggage. It even features an integrated recordplayer - forseeing the
            development of modern multipurpose receiver/CD-player combinations.
