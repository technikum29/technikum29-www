     There are no more robotics courses at the technikum.
  </h3>
  <p>The courses presented on this page were given between the years 2016 and 2017 at
  high schools in the regional district as well as on education centers for youths.
  Since the sudden <a href="/heribert-mueller">death of eribert Müller</a>, they are
  canceled. Most likely, they will never take place in the same way. This page
  exists only in order to show what has happened at the technikum in former days.

<h3>Educational training at a museal site</h3>

<p>Programming as a basic competence in the age of information is a common goal of
government and industry. The popular IT companies of the web 2.0 demonstrate:
Programmers could be the new pop stars. At technikum29, we join this movement by
inspiring youths to build robots. It's fun and supports creativity.

<div class="small">Students' group</div>
</div>



<p>We offer two courses: An introductory course which is mainly based
on graphical programming. In the advanced course, students learn to
program with a programming language at the Mindstorms Education EV3 system.

<p>We supervise up to 10 students per course, each with an own robot
which is provided. Our workshops are for students in the age of
11 up to 13 years. We also collaborate with adult evening classes
(Volkshochschule in Germany) to offer similar courses for unskilled
adults.

<h3>The robotics course</h3>
<p>
Our robotics course promotes graphical programming with the LEGO Mindstorms
technology. We build robots which can navigate autonomously.
In our course, students learn:

<ul>

<li>Introducion to sensors, Independent linear programming according to
  worksheets. Introduction of loops. Planing and testing of applications.
<li>From graphical programming to system programming: Branching, jumps,
  sub programms, multitasking and interrupts.
<li>Entertaining navigation: Driving off lines. Our mars rover finds
  obstacles, recognizes colours, records and plays voice or draws
  figures with pens.
<li>From graphical programming to logic: pipes, variables, the LEGO
  math block. Counting, comparing, understanding decisions based on
  boolean states.
<li>Everything is fun. The level of learning always matches the
  pupils' age.
</ul>

<p>Three years ago, the "foundation" was laid here in the <i> technikum29 </i>. The kids, now 9th graders, discovered their enthusiasm for robotics. Ben Huber (15) and Martin Vekony (15) won the 2nd prize in the world finale of the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) in Costa Rica with their robot-supported battery replacement station. <br> A total of over 59 nations competed in several Rounds from 10.-12. November 2017 the critical eyes of international jurors. It was "The Mindfactory 2.0" in the Junior Open category in Costa Rica by 33 international teams to prevail at the top and thus came on the winner's podium. More than 1,296 teams started participating in the Open Junior category worldwide.<br>
