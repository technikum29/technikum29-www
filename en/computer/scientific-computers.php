    </div>
		
		<p>This machine is particularly interesting in more than one way: 1) The hardware
is extremely simple, 2) the machine already employs a bus system for
interconnecting the various units. 3) The machine features a fixed disk which
holds all registers as well as timing tracks. As the picture above shows we
have two complete systems which simplifies troubleshooting and repair.<br>

Citing from the original brochure (1964): "The LGP-21 is produced by Schoppe &
Faeser as a licensee in Europe and is distributed by EUROCOMP GmbH."<br>

The LGP-21 had been developed by Librascope, division GP1 (USA). This company
once was one of the largest calculating machine manufacturers in the world.
Starting in 1962 the LGP-21 was marketed in the USA by General Precision. The
machine is a very small computer but was advertised as "The first complete
program controlled digital computer for only $16,250 in the minimum
configuration." This configuration consisted of the CPU and a Flexowriter only.
This machine was the successor of the <a class="go" href="/en/computer/lgp30.php"><b>LGP-30</b></a> (1st generation, 1956, also build
by Schoppe & Faeser in Germany as a licensed product). The LGP-21 is very rare
- only about 100 machines were built in Germany. Even rarer is the magnetic
tape unit of which only 5 known units were built. The machine in the museum has
serial number 4.</p>

		<p class="bildtext small">The external memory of the LGP-21 are perforated papertapes, which are scanned mechanically of the Tally-tape reader. The magnetic tape drive and other external drives were added in the late 60s.</p></div>
		
<p>As external storage the LGP-21 employs a paper tape system using Tally
papertape readers. The magnetic tape unit and two external disks with a
capacity of about 8000 words each were added in the late 1960s.<br>

A rotating disk serves as the machine's main memory and clock generator. It
rotates with 1475 RPM and holds 4096 words of 32 bits each which equals 12 kB,
a reasonable size back then.

		<img src="/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/lgp21-platte.jpg" width="300" height="270" alt="LGP-21 disk drive" /></a>
	</div>
<br>
The disk contains 64 data tracks, four timing tracks and tracks for three registers (accumulator, instruction register and
counter register). 
The mean write density is about 10 Bit/mm (about 1/200th of
today's disk drives).<br>
The LGP-21 supports 23 different instructions - enough to program typical
scientific applications.<br>

Repairing the machine turned out to be quite a challenge. Having two machines
of this type helps a lot.

    <p>Today's kids think of the latest mobile devices when talking about "mini computers".
	   In contrast, in the 1960s and the early 70s, a computer was always huge (like our
	   <a href="univac9400.php">UNIVAC mainframe</a>), thus a 300kg computer was "mini".
	   Early computers are well worth seeing due to their enormous size and the nice
	   transparent auxillary devices.
       <br />There is a very important computer family that finally lead to (today's)
	   personal computers: The development of the "Mini" computers from Digital Equipment
	   Corporation (DEC), series PDP-8 and PDP-12 (both 12-bit architecture). The museum
	   owns a complete production run from that devices: From the PDP-8 (also called
	   Classic-8), year of manufacture 1965 to the PDP-8a (1975, this one is less 
	   important so it is located in the archive). PDP means Programmed Data Processor.

        <img src="/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/dec/flip-chip-module.jpg" width="400" height="173" alt="Flip-Chip-Module" />
		<p>The manuals of these computers are very detailed, with full circuit
		   documentation. There never have been any other computer with such an
		   elaborate documentation. For restoration purposes these manuals are
		   indispensable. Even in those days, other manufacturers kept their
		   blueprints in secret for fear of unauthorized re-use (e.g. HP).

		<p>PDP computers were especially used by scientists. By using self-made
		   (CPU) interface boards, already existing (experimental) equipment could easily
		   migrated to the new hardware. DEC even offered prefabricated boards to
		   encourage own extension development.
		   The figure above shows a typical second generation module (1965) without ICs
		   from the classic PDP-8 on the left. In the middle is a smaller third generation
		   module with ICs (from 1967) which was used in the PDP-8i, PDP-8L and PDP-12.
		   On the right is an empty module just suitable for being equipped by the
		   user for interfaces to own periphery.<br>

	
         One of the museum highlights: The complete PDP-8 system with processor,
         a big tape deck TU-580 (originally belonged to the PDP-5, manufactured in 1963),
         punch card reader/puncher PC-01, hard-disc DF-32 with immovable heads
         and a teletype as printer. The Classic PDP-8 is considered the world's first mass-produced
         "minicomputer". Due it's use of ICs, unlike its predecessors, it is considered
		 a second-generation computer.
	</p>
		 
		<p>This computer features various different logic and register modules. All logic
		is only built with NAND and NOR gatters. Registers are constructed with flip-flop
		circuits. The extensive wiring of the modules (see picture) is called
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wrap">Wire wrapping</a>. This kind of
		connections were used in all bigger computers until the 1980s, since it is an
		easy way to connect two points which are not mounted on the same board or on the
		same level. In the early days this wiring was manually performed and later executed
		by machines. Even today there are still some wire-wrap-connections in testing
		environments.
		<br>
		The picture shows the uncovered computer with opened right wing where you can easily
		see the wire-wrap connections.</p>

	  <p>In 1967 the first series 74xx TTL ICs (transistor-transistor logic) came on the market.
	     DEC was at the bleeding edge, releasing the 8i ("with <b>i</b>ntegrated circuits"). No one
		 knew about the stability of the new ICs (later bugs). Therefore UNIVAC used the well established
		 DTL technology even two years after. Fortunately, the TTL ICs proved to be as stable as the DTL
		 series. Since the integration degree was much higher, less space has been needed for computers.
		 <br>DEC's first calculator with integrated circuits was very expensive. The CPU on alone
		 (in the picture: Left case, middle) cost US$ 27,000 without peripherals at that time.
         <br>The main memory had a capacity of 8kB. While computing a "large" problem, it was possible to swap
         programs or data to files on magnetic tape and read in afterward be reread. DEC developed
         an intelligent operating system (OS/8) which worked very efficiently with such little memory.
         It is very interesting to watch this computer working.</p>
         <p>If you have not been in the presence of this computer, you should know that it is quite large.
         With the plotter, it stands at a height of almost 7' (2m) and weighting at more than 600 lbs (300kg).</p>
         <p>The peripherals consist of two TU-55 (tape drives), a PC-04 (high speed paper tape reader),
         Calcomp 563 plotter (at the top) and of course a teletype (not pictured).

		<br>Our PDP-8L has many extensions: HSR (High Speed) paper tape reader, TC01 Tape Control

		<br>DEC invented the interpreted programming language <b>FOCAL</b> (Formulating Online

			<p>The PDP-12 was released in 1969. Just 755 units were sold worldwide. It was the last series that
			could operate in LINC-Mode (it could be switched to either LINC
			or PDP-8 Mode). This is a laboratory computer, equipped with AD and DA
			converter as standard. Such computers were usually kept up to date
			with hardware updates. The memory of this device was gradually
			increased from 8kB up to 32kB (DW 08E storage extension).
			<br>Besides the tape drives, the computer was also equipped with
			an 8-inch floppy drive. Afterwards they were removed again in
			favor of two removable disk drives. Finally they even tied the
			device to 10BASE-T ethernet, using a selfmade controller with an
			handwritten TCP/IP stack on a selfmade operating system.

	<p>By having all the following options, our computer was very comfortable
	(the number in parentheses indicates the number of neccessary boards):</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>AD12 [A-D-Control] (12 modules):
		<dd>The AD12 includes 16 channels of input, 10bit output resolution and features
		    up to 60kHz signals at 30dB down.
		
		<dt>DM12 [Data Break Multiplexer for KF12-B] (6 modules):
		<dd>The DM12 provides the capability of operating up to three data break devices.
		    The Data Break facility allows an I/O device to transfer information directly
			with the PDP-12 core memory on a cycle-stealing basis. This is particulary
			well suited for high-speed devices which transfer large amounts of information
			in block form. Peripheral I/O equipment  could reach a maximum transfer rate
			of 6,5 Mbit/sec.
		
		<dt>DP12A [TTY-Dataphone] (4 modules):
		<dd>The DP12 options permit interfacing additional Teletypes and Modems. They are
		    capable of accepting data asynchronously up to 100,000 baud. The units are
			designed for US-ASCII and meet the EIA-standard (RS232) requirements.
		
		<dt>DR12 [Relays and Control] (1 module):
		<dd>The relay buffer is a six-bit register connected to six relays that are mounted
		    on the data terminal panel. They can be used for controlling experiments or
			external equipment not otherwise directly interfaced with the PDP-12 Computer.
			The states of the relays can be examinede at any time via the register.
		
		<dt>KE12 [Extended Arithmetik Element] (14 modules):
		<dd>The EAE enables the CP (the DEC operating system) to perform arithmetic
		    operations at higher speed. The ALU is extended by asynchronous logic such as a
			12-bit Multiplier Quotient Register and a 5-bit Step Counter.  These components
			are used by auxillary CPU instructions (opcodes).
			
		<dt>KF12 [Multi Level] (54 modules):
		<dd>The Multi-Level Automatic Priority Interrupt is designed to reduce the CPU
		    overhead during the servicing of program interrupts. Up to 15 levels of interrupts
			can be accomodated with each level having an unique vector address. The interrupts
			can be accepted from other options (CPU extensions) or from up to six external
			devices. Storing of priority and vectoring of interrupt service routines is
			performed with a Stack.
			
		<dt>KT12 [Time-Sharing Option] (2 modules):
		<dd>This module provides the additional logic circuits required for the PDP12 Time
		    Sharing System. Having satisfied the minimum equipment, it perimts up to 16 users
			to operate their individual programs in an apperantly simultaneous manner. The
			system is controlled by a group of subprograms called "TSS/12 Monitor".
			
		<dt>KW12-A [Real Time Clock] (19 modules):
		<dd>The RTC can be used to generate Program Interrupts over a range of intervals of
		    2.5us to 40.96s; detect external and internal events in order to count them,
			measure them against a time base, measure the interval between them, use them as
			time base standard or control sample times of A/D conversions. In our system
			this module was used to connect the german longwave time signal radio station 
			DCF77 in order to recieve the atomic clock time from the German master clocks
			in Frankfurt.

<p>	Edson de Castro was responsible for product management at DEC and was intent
on developing a 16-bit computer with a processor that would fit on a single
printed circuit board. But Ken Olson, the founder of DEC, wasn't
supportive. So de Castro left DEC in 1968 together with three other
hardware engineers to found his own company in a vacant barber's shop:
<b>Data General Corporation </b>(Massachusetts, USA).<br>

Already in 1969 the first 16-bit computer in the <b>"NOVA" </b>series was ready
for the market. Thanks to the simpler production method (no wire wrapping,
only two boards + memory boards etc.) the basic version was quite inexpensive
at $4000. However, this basic model alone wasn't really that useful, and
after extending the computer the total price was substantially higher.
The Nova computer was advertised as "the best small computer in the world".
At this time, DEC was still building the PDP-8/I and the PDP-12, which 
required lots of very small flip-chip-modules. <br>

The successor model (available in 1973), the<b> NOVA 2</b>, was simplified even
further, and the increased chip density made it possible to have the whole
processor together with the control logic for slow peripheral devices
(teletype, paper tape puncher and reader) one single board. Our Nova is a
NOVA 2/10 model with slots for 10 boards, and therefore enough space for
quite a few device controllers and memory extensions.<br>


From today's perspective, the rather huge boards (15x15 inch,
nicknamed "circuit graveyards in baking tray size") do have disadvantages:
any kind of repair is very difficult, because it is not possible to pin down
a malfunction by exchanging small boards.<br>

The NOVA shown in the picture is from a university. It is equipped with
two harddisk drives, one twin floppy drive (8" disks!), one teletype,
one high-speed paper tape punch reader and one punch card reader (not in 
the picture). Later on a terminal was added, which extended the computer
to a comfortably usable system.</p>
