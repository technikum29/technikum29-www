      <p>It is quite incredible: Fax machines were already mass-produced in 1929. However, it
      was difficult to run these machines. The first pracitcal fax machines are a german invention: The "Normalpapierfax" (a fax machine that
      used usual paper) from Siemens-Hell, year of manufacture 1956, with tube technology, is still completely runable.
      An unhurried and transparent fax transmission (DIN A5) takes about 4 minutes. Theoretically you
      could send a colored fax with that machine!</p>

                Who hasn't felt, when listening to a thrilling wireless transmission
                from the opera or when enjoying a radio play, the wish to experience
                such a feat not only with one's ears, but also with one's eyes? How
                often have you regretted to rely solely on your own imagination rather
                than being able to actually see the presentations which sound so
                natural in your ears?
                The realisation of these aspirations, which would be possible by
                distance cinema, has not only failed due to the technical complexities
                of the problems, but especially because of the enormous costs caused
                by such an equipment.
                It is now a truly invaluable achievement that every owner of a good
                wireless apparatus has been put into a position to call something his
                own, which is at least a preliminary stage of a distance cinema, namely
                a radiophoto receiver, providing beautiful and steady images out of the
                ether.
                In the future, broadcasting stations will be able to illustrate their
                acoustic transmissions. Scenic images of public performances, portraits
                of artists, comments on lectures, illustrations of daily reports,
                sketches of sporting events, weather charts, public quizzes and many

              <blockquote>
                other such events can be made an issue of broadcasting in a simple way.
                All owners of a suitable apparatus can &ndash; without previous technical
                knowledge and without a dark room &ndash; receive these images, which
                will appear in front of your eyes in brilliant brown colour in a matter
                of minutes and which will be ready in stable conditions immediately.
                The simple appliance providing such miracles was quietly developed to
                such a perfection by an English inventor, Captain Otho Fulton, and within
                a short period of time regular image broadcasting will be carried out
                in most European countries, so that the owner of a "Fultograph" &ndash;
                this is how Fulton called his image receiver &ndash; will be able to
                receive an international image broadcasting programme in his own home.
                The images are true to the originals, distinct and pleasant to watch,
                and apart from that of particular artistic efficacy because of their
                special granularity.
                It takes 3 to 5 minutes to transmit a picture in the format of 9 to
                12 centimetres.

               <p>The rotating roll, which had been coated with chemically preperated paper, was spirally
                 scanned by an attached "pen" (tabluator). In this way an electric current could flow
                 from the pen over the paper to the roll in the rythm of the picture informations. That way, the

	      This "remote copy machine" was produced in 1954/55. The ink-based write
		  approach was already matured. Sad to say, the service-friendliness was
		  quite bad. The bulky device (27 kilogram) scans only a DIN A5 sheet.
		  Already 1956 the successor KF 108 came on the market, with great 
		  improvements.

          The KF 108 works in a similar way like the Fultograph. Instead of the
		  electrochemical recording, ink is put on the usual paper with the help
		  of complex mechanics.

          <br/>It works similar to the fultograph. Instead of a electochemical
		  notation, ink is brought by a small rotating sapphire reel onto normal
		  paper.
          <br/>A KF 108 will even be able to send and recive faxes when the modern
		  fax devices are trashed. Of course, it is not compatible to today's
		  devices. Siemens produced the device in a typical german manner: Everything 
		  is huge and indestructible. In these days you did not throw everything away.

	      The next fax (year of manufacture 1963, also used for weather cards) weights
		  90 kg and has even electonic tubes. In the 1960s, weather offices were able
		  to recive the latest weather cards (with pages bigger than DIN A3) with
		  these machines.
		  <br/>The Hellfax-Blattschreiber BS 100 shows how exhausting it was to send
		  DIN A2 fax drawings in the 1960s. This device was used to recive weather
		  cards with radio communication. You can also see an <a class="go"
