	<h2>Punch-card equipment and Peripherals</h2>
</header>
    

    <p>Punch cards are used since the beginnings of the 20th century
       as storage media. They are handy, can be labeled automatically or by
       hand, and can be sorted quickly. Therefore they were used until
       the late 1980s. Indeed they were mainly used in the 1960s, when
       EDP conquered the world. Today's folk is astonished at the size,
       the clearness and functionality of these machines. At technikum29
       most of these archaic devices still work.</p>

           <p>For punching cards only occasionally, the small bottom device
	       was quite sufficient, e.g. for small companies. The device in
	       the middle of the picture is a puncher from BULL and the topmost
	       device is a so-called "magnetic puncher" that is equipped with
	       solenoids that punch the holes. For even higher amounts of
	       punching requirements, there were quite more expensive
	       "motor-driven punchers".

    <p>A typical machinery consists of a card puncher which punches the
       information and data on the cards, a card collator which sorts
       the cards from different stacks (for instance <i>adresses</i>
       and <i>bills</i>), a sorter which sorts with specified loads
       and possibly a punch card interpreter that writes the punched
       information on a prescribed position on the punch card.</p>

	<p class="bildtext" id="026"><b id="026">IMB 026 Printing-Card-Punch</b></p>
	Beginning in 1949 IBM built two versions of this card punch: The IBM 024
which could just punch cards and the IBM 026 which could additionally print
the data being punched on the top of the card in human-readable form, so the
IBM 026 was actually a printing card punch. The printer is of ingenious
design: A very compact wire printer only a couple of cubic inches in size,
which is driven by the punch mechanism.<br>
This is a typical example for the art of engineering that was common at IBM
at that time: Developing simple, yet powerful solutions. Due to this
approach, IBM filed (and still does) a vast amount of patent applications. 
The control system of the card punch only contains 10 relays featuring a lot
of contact sets and 9 vacuum tubes.<br>
This card punch was so successful that it was built unmodified for 20 years
and was sold world wide - an exceptional record in an area like electronic
data processing.</p>

	<p> On the left hand in the picture there is the legendary
	    IBM 029 (build since 1964), on the right hand the JUKI puncher
	    (made in Japan). The JUKI puncher is not accidentally looking
	    like the IBM: The type 129 card punch was introduced by IBM in 1971. It is capable of storing
the contents of a whole card prior to punching it, thus making corrections
possible. Therefore IBM selled the license of the 029 to reproduce the machine. In
	    1971, the IBM 029 costed about 15.500 DM.

		IBM's answer to the electronic card punch UNIVAC 1710 was its most
sophisticated and last member of its venerable family of card punched, the
model 129. Every usable modern technology was incorporated in this device: Data
and punch programs were stored in a FET-based memory, early seven-segment LED
displays were used to diplay the current column, the card transport employed a
stepper motor. A very complex SLT-based control logic implements a wide
variety of features: Verification of punched cards, printing the data stored on
a card on its edge, storing up to six customized card formats etc.<br>

The IBM 129 is a rather rare find since the market for card punches was already
saturated in the early 1970s. In addition to this the decline of punch card
equipment was already forseeable.<br>

Our machine has a serial line interface as an add-on which we are currently
repairing.

	</div>
	
	<p>
           The Univac 1710 VIP was released at
           the same time like the <a href="univac9400.php">UNIVAC 9400 mainframe</a>
           in the year 1969. This device is very fast and versatile and works mostly
           electronically. Most likely, Univac wanted to trump IBM with this
           trendsetting device. The device's internals are very elaborate, but offer
           many advantages, compared to usual apperatures at that time:
           <br/>It featured a core memory with 16 x 80 x 2 cells for both data and programs. It could
           handle two programs and one data storage. Programming
           was performed automatically once program cards have been inserted, and
           programs could be changed at the touch of a key. The device furthermore
           featured program-controlled printing during punching.
           Keypunching errors were electronically corrected, since cards were punched
           only after all entries were in storage. Verifying and correction comprised
           a one-pass operation. Verified cards were uniquely notched while error
           cards were automatically ejected to a separate stacker.
           <br/>The device also features a large illuminated digital display that
           indicates which program is in control, furthermore the device could be
           used for subsequent card labeling. However, the device had always
           mechanical problems: The type wheel print was of bad quality and the
           card feeding could easily stop working when the adjustment wasn't
           perfectly fitting.

			<p>New in December 2013: Huge and incredibly heavy - an IBM card doubler from the
1950s. This grand machine's purpose was just to copy punched cards or to 
'double' them. Due to the stress of handling, punched cards had to be copied
regularly. 
<br>Of course, there are some additional functions implemented, although
there is no function to print plaintext on the card, which would have been a
nice feature, but this is where the IBM 548 translator comes into play. 
A more detailed description will follow soon.</p>

            <br/>Compared to the IBM 082 the sorting mechanics were greatly improved. The machine can sort 1000 cards
            per minute. Much more than 16 cards per second are not possible, due to the mechanic's inertia. This
            type was built since 1958.

	<h3>Collators</h3>

        <p class="bildtext"><b>IBM punch card collator 077</b></p>
		<p>
	    The picture above shows the back of a collator, year of manufacture 1959.
		The collector reads 480 cards per minute. It is capable of changing the 
		order of the cards, looking for copies (and seperating them out) or
		comparing two stacks and finding out the differences. Compared to 
		today's database storages this card collator is a kind of mechanical
		database query language interpreter.
        <!--<br/>The programs are plugged together on a patch panel. Thus they can easily be changed. -->
        <br />The electronics comprises of relays and camshafts which control
	     switches. Early engineers had to use oilcans for the bearing's
	     maintenance as often as a checking device.
	     <br />The programs could be changed by replacing the programing field.

	    This very big device features very much chrome and almost 1000 relays,
		assembled to allow developers to implement varoius mixing algorithms
		with wired panels. Thus collating and sorting could be performed in only
		one working cycle. Depending on the task, the device could process about
		250 - 500 cards per minute.

             with lifted cover.</p>
		  <p>Just standing in front of this behemoth is an impressive experience. The
overall weight of this mechanical wonder amounts to 635 kg and is sturdy
enough to print a next to uncountable number of pages without any major
defects. The series 5 printer was developed in the USA in 1963/64 and was
used by many computer manufacturers (as a matter of fact, even ZUSE used this
printer for the Z-23 - other examples include the Electrologica X8 from the
Netherlands etc.). Being able to print 1250 lines per minute it was the
fastest printer until 1965.<br>
Our ANELEX printer has been repaired and can now be controlled by a
microcontroller which in turn can be connected to a Laptop or the like. This
is a nice example of a symbiosis of old and modern computing technology.
