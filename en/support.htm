<h2>We are looking for patrons</h2>

<p>After the sudden pass of <a href="/heribert-mueller/">Heribert Müller</a>
in 2018, the museum is about to be start from scratch. We are working hard
to prepare the foundation of a non-profit society (<em>Gemeinnütziger
Verein</em> in German, a legal entity). We are looking for support of any
kind: It doesn't even matter where you are located and whether you can
donate time or money.

<h3>Support in person: Get an associate</h3>
<p>Many of us live far away from the Rhine-Maine metropolitan area, where the
museum is located. Some of us come from southern Germany, some from northern
Germany. Many of us have to travel half a day to reach the museum. Thankfully,
Frankfurt is well-connected in terms of rail traffic and it's large
international airport.

<p>Nevertheless, we maintain a large website and
<a href="https://github.com/technikum29">a lot of code</a>. We always look for
people willing to contribute for hosting, authoring and writing, doing artwork,
public outreach, writing mails, or creating relationships with other institutes.

<p>Currently, we maintain a list of people interested in shaping the future
of the museum, as well as just getting informed regularly about updates from
our house. <a href="/en/contact.php">Drop us a mail</a> if you want to get put
on the list.

<h3>Financial support: Donations</h3>
<p>Happily, the technikum computer museum has the great luck of occupying private
rooms only. Nevertheless, supply costs (energy, heating expenses) only are several
hundreds of Euro per month. At some point, the museum must be able to cover these
costs in order to sustain its rooms. This is something where we also depend on
external donations.

<p>We can recieve donation payments in various ways:


<ul>
<li>Traditional bank account (SEPA/SWIFT transfer within European) is the cheapest
    way for us to recieve payments:

<blockquote>
   IBAN: <tt>DE10 1203 0000 1071 8532 51</tt>
   <br>BIC/SWIFT: <tt>BYLADEM1001</tt>
   <br>Name of Bank: Deutsche Kreditbank (DKB)
</blockquote>

<li>We have a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/technikum29">Github sponsorship</a> profile
   (suitable for recurring payments)
   
<li>We have a <a href="https://patreon.com/technikum29">pateron profile technikum29</a>
