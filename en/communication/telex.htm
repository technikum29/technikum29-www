<p>	The heyday of mechanics in telecommunications was clearly marked by a wide
variety of teletypewriters (by the way - this reflects until today in the
naming of serial line interface devices in UNIX which are traditionally called
"tty"). The so-called "Springschreiber T32" is quite rare and was built between
the 1930s and the 1950s. It writes onto a narrow paper strip. It is built so
heavily that it is nearly indestructible. As F. Schiweck ("Fernschreibtechnik",
1942) notes:<br>

<blockquote>"The Teletypewriter is one of this most stunning productions and a marvel of
mechanical design. It requires the best materials available and is a marvel of
construction. According to general opinion, its relability of operation is
extremely high."</blockquote>
<br>

Back in those heydays of mechanical engineering the field engineers required a
steady hand, good hearing to spot troublesome noises, and, of course, an oil
can as well. Their profession vanished in the 1980s.</p>

    Links: Hellschreiber GL 72 (ca. Bj. 1952). Jede Taste erzeugt eine
    bestimmte Tonsequenz. Mit diesen Geräten konnte man daher im
    Gegensatz zu den Fernschreibern im Telefonnetz kommunizieren.
    
    Rechts: Diktiergerät mit Magnetplatten (Bj. 1952), welches auch die
    Informationen des Hellschreibers aufzeichnen konnte. Damit wurde es
    schließlich möglich Text auf einer Magnetplatte abzuspeichern und
    beliebig oft durch den Hellschreiber "ausdrucken" zu lassen.

            The <b>Hellschreiber GL 72</b>, year of manufacture 1952
            (in the picture on the left). This device assignes an unique
            sequence of frequencies to each key. Thus the device could make use of the
            telephone network, like the later modems did to build up the
            internet. This feature distinguishes it from the ordinary
            teletypes.

    <p>Nevertheless the clatting teletypes coined high speed
       telecommunication for decades. The first teletype was presented
       in 1930 by Siemens &amp; Halske &ndash; only three years later,
       the German Post used them for communication all over Germany.
       The first official connection in Germany was build between the capital, Berlin,
       and the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. Unlike the
       Hellschreiber, the teletype did not use the already existing
       telephone network, so they had to build up a seperate telex
       network.
       <br/>
       At first there were only 21 subscribers in 1933, but only six
       years later, they counted 1500 subscribers in 1939. In 1975
       there were actually more than 90,000 subscribers. In these
       days, the mechanically working teletypes were replaced by
       electronically driven devices (Telex). Even nowadays, in
       times of the internet, a few developing countries use this
       disaster safe kind of communication.</p>

	    Below in the picture, you can see a paper tape sender.
        While typing the text, it was fed into the paper tape and could be send afterwards quite fast.
        This is quite equal how today's e-mail clients work: They buffer the text while the user inputs
        it until it is send in one go, instead of streaming the keyboard input "live" to the recipient.
        Of course this apperature is still fully executable.

<p>Recently we saved this large (70cm by 60cm) and wonderful "decoder" from scrap
at a local university. This device translates 5 bit telegraph codes to their
corresponding characters. It has been built as a demonstration object by the
university's machine shop sometime between 1937 and 1949 and has been used
extensively in lectures.<br>
Principle of operation: A 5 bit value is set by means of the large levers. Then
the code wheel is turned slowly until the correct character is in the top
position which is denoted by lighting a lamp. If, e.g., 10101 is set and the
code wheel is turned, the lamp will be lit under the character "Y".<br>
What once was state-of-the-art technology is now used as a decoding device for
our experimental workshops. There kids can decipher texts given in binary and
thus gain experience with binary data representation.</p>

     <p>Long time before, telegraph offices (about 1900), the early teleprinters (1938) and Hellschreiber (1952) were used. A demonstration shows something unbelievable: The Hellschreiber writes a dictate from a dictating machine from the early fifties without mistakes!?<br/>
     <br/>The electomechanical "text processing systems" (1962-64) show you how texts could be duplicated and written automatically with punched tapes and punch cards as storages. Only big companies could afford the complex technology which was typically german.
