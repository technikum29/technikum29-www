<p>The Telefunken broadcasting device Type 40W (year of manufacture 1929) is build
 aesthetically appealing. At that time, technology was comprehensible even for
 (educated) laymen. On the other hand, the operation was not very comfortable:
 The volume had to be adjusted by combining the antenna matching (the turn-switch
 on the left) and the feedback (turn-switch on the right). When the feedback was
 increased too much, the broadcasting reciever became an "jamming transmitter".</p>

<p>The device looks good from below, too. It's built on a pressed paper sheet
  instead of a sheet chassis. Electrical connections are partially realized by
  rivet strip conductors. Not until the 1950s, that method was implemented again,
  leading to the printed circuit boards.</p>
