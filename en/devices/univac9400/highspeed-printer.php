        <p>Even small mainfraimes had a highspeed printer. This monster has a
	printing capacity of 26 lines per second and features 635 kg.
        <br />As you could play "music" with old chainprinters by
	printing a special typeface (the River Kwai March was a typical
	sound),	these jokes are not possible with this barrel printer.</p>
