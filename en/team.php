  <h2>Team</h2>
  
  <p>Since the  <a href="/heribert-mueller/">sudden death of the founder and maintainer Heribert MÃ¼ller</a>,
  the technikum29 computer museum is still in an interim phase. It is currently maintained by a group of
  volunteers, which are presented on this page. This doesn't display the full picture, since
  the big network of friends and supporters is not (yet) listed.</p>
