   <p><b>This website has not been updated since 2018 ! You can find our current
	   page in German <a href="/de/">here</b></a>.
   <p>technikum29 is a private science museum in Germany, close to Frankfurt am Main.
      It has a focus on computer history between the 1920s and 1980s. The unique property
      of our exhibition is that we strieve to present every single device in an operational state.
   <p>Highlights of our collection are the data centers: We have a number of larger facilities installed
      in our rooms, such as several <a href="/en/computer/univac9400/">Univac data centers</a>,
      as well as a number of bulky <a href="/en/computer/punchcard/">punchcard machines</a>.
      Furthermore, the museum covers a number of different topics, such as the development of
      <a href="/en/communication/broadcasting/">broadcasting</a> and
      <a href="/en/communication/television/">television</a> within this time span. Our website
      shows almost all topics presented on 250 square meters of exhibition.
   <p>First and foremost, this is a living museum and shall become a lively place where interested
      people can work and spend time with vintage computers. Ressources on this website shall provide
      a glimpse on the way how we work on restauration and operation.

      <h2>Unique in Germany</h2>
      <p>All exhibits in technikum29 are operational. There are no information boards,
         instead selected devices are presented within a guided tour by experts.
      <p>This is very different from popular computer history and science museus.
         Similar concepts can be found world wide only in a couple of other computer
         museums, such as the
         <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/">UK Computing History Museum</a>,
         the <a href="https://livingcomputers.org/">Seattle Living Computer Museum</a>
         and of course the <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/">Californian
         Computer History Museum</a>. In these three exemplary museums, the restauration
         of computers is the exception, not the rule.
      <p>The exhibition is limited on extraordinary rarities. That's why it is also
         enjoying an excellent reputation among enthusiasts.


      <h2>✝ Heribert Müller</h2>
      <p>In April 2018, the founder of the computer museum,
         <a href="/heribert-mueller/">Heribert Müller</a>, has died. In 2005, he founded
         the technikum29 computer museum in its todays form in a former bank building.
         The number <em>29</em> references to the house number. The term <em>technikum</em>
         referes to a special kind of engineering school which was popular in Germany in the
         20th century. Heribert Müller was high school teacher for math and physics. His
         philosophy envisages an electronical/technical education based on the history of
         communication and computing history. As a child of the early post war Germany of the
         1950s, he had a faible for tubes, which were amongst the most sophisticated
         technology at that time, and were used in all kind of modern devices. On the
         other hand, his interest for computing technology ends with further integration
         and intransparency of the personal computer generation (1980s).

        <h2>Making a Visit</h2>
        <p>The technikum29 is a private museum. Due to the sudden death of its maintainer
           in April 2018, we currently (still) do not offer any public openings. When
           he was still alive, guided tours in German language
           were given on a quite regular level, which typically lasted for about 90 minutes.
          
        <p>In January 2020 friends and supporters of technikum29 re-open the museum
           <a href="/de/termine/">and offer guided tours</a>.
