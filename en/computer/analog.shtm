They were especially capable of solving equations    containing variables that depend on time or differential equations.</p>    <p>Analog computers simulate the given problem by abstracting it to a    physical system which follows the same mathematical laws. This    system is "plugged together" on a patch-board by using electronical    networks which are situated in the computer's inner life (negators,    summing unit, integrator, multiplier, function generator, etc.). Unlike    digital ones, analog computers don't count but measure (input) parameters.    Thus an anlog computer does not even recognize the complexity of a    differential equation &ndash; it solves even non-linear ones where    there does not exist any approach very quickly by simply drawing the    graph of the solution. On the other hand, analog computers are not suitable for    solving literal equations and suitable for commercial calculations    not at all.</p>    <p>All systems that yield the same mathematical model are called analog    systems among one another, disregarding their technical or physical origins.    The quality of the analogy of a system depends on the accuracy of    both approximation and output. According to the price the available    analog computers at that time highly differed from each other.    <p>Among others, computer systems by Telefunken (1961-64) are installed. They drew awesome curves on a storage oscilloscope and xy plotter. They solved difficult problems quite quickly, but handing, programming (plug connections) and analysis is not easy.</p>    <!--alter Text: <p>Electronical analog computers solved mathematical    equations that represented electrical networks which you had to plug    ("programm") on the board. They were solved by the electrical simulation.    Results were not numbers, but graphs (curves) that can be plotted with a    writer or an oscilloscope.</p>-->    <h3>Heathkit Analog Computer H1</h3>    <div class="box center" style="margin-bottom: 0;">        <img src="/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/heathkit-analog-computer.jpg" width="694" height="443" alt="Heathkit Analog Computer H1" />        <p>Heathkit, known for it's construction kits, developed an analog        computer in 1956 that was primary designed for education.

It was built since 1960 and was equipped           with only 17 tubes (whereas 5 were used for stabilisation of           voltage). With such a sparse equipment the device is just good           enough to yield the function of an analog computer &ndash; it is too           inexactly to be used for real computing.           <br/>This device costed around 1.900 DM (about 900 Euro/500US$) </p>    </div>    <div class="box right">        <h3>Telefunken RAT 700</h3>        <img src="/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/telefunken_rat700.jpg" width="291" height="917" alt="Telefunken RAT 700" class="nomargin-bottom" />        <p class="bildtext">            The image shows the <b>Telefunkten RAT 700</b> in the bottom (first            model from 1961), above a part from the successor. On the new model            you can change the whole patch board and thus change prgorams quickly.            <br/>When it's running, you hear an undetermined buzzing (400 Hz), due            to the mechanical chopper that change direct voltage in alternating            voltage. That was the only chance to disable the disturbing termeratre            drift (Changing of the germanium transistor parameters). Principally,            direct voltage is amlified by using choppers still today, but of course            they are made with electronic components.        </p>    </div>    <div class="box center" style="margin-right: 291px">        <h3>GTE Analog Computer EA22</h3>        <img src="/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/gte-analogrechner.jpg" width="312" height="346" title="GTE Analog computer EA22" />        <p>          It's quite remarkable that the EA22 from GTE looks like the Telefunken          computers.

The calculation circuit is plugged with cables on the front panel. The cycle time from the analoge part can be set to less than 10ms.

Among others there are digital potentiometers             (gating pulse manually adjustable), a highly customizable digital clock generator (which uses             nixie tubes as a display), a digital counter, two function generators and many more.             This computer was built in the early 1970s and was priced at 80.000 DM (about 40.000 euro/dollar)         </p>    </div>	<h3>(Cylindrical) slide rules</h3>    <div class="box center">        <img src="/shared/photos/rechnertechnik/rechenschieber.jpg"          alt="Slide rule (slipstick) and Cylindrical slide rule" width="694" height="161"/>    </div>    <p>        Last but not least a mechanical analog computer that was used up to        the 1970s for scientific calculations without hand and desk calculators.        <br/>The picture above displays a 1.8m long demo slide rule        made of wood (1950s) that was used in schools for students since the        10th grade.

The big        disadvantage was that adding and subtracting was not possible at all.        <br/>To get higher precisions in the 1920s, there was this        "Cylindrical slide rule".
